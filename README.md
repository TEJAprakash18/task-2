#GETTING STARTED WITH MACHINE LEARNING IN PYTHON

    Machine learning is one of the new technologies to emerge into popular consciousness in the last decade.

    #What is Data Science?

         Data science is the field of study that combines domain expertise, programming skills, and knowledge of mathematics and statistics to extract meaningful insights from            data. Data science practitioners apply machine learning algorithms to numbers, text, images, video, audio, and more to produce artificial intelligence (AI) systems to            perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence. 

    #Data Science Process

         Data Science Process involves several important steps:
            1. Frame the problem
            2.Collect the raw data needed to solve the problem
            3.Process the data
            4.Explore the data
            5.Perform in-depth analysis
            6.Communicate results of the analysis

         #1.Frame the problem:

             knowing who is your client and what the client needs. 
             Construct the client requests into a well-defined problem.

         #2.Collect the raw data needed to solve the problem: 

             check the available of data and analyse the quality of those data. 
             Collecting more data if needed.

         #3.Process the data: 

             It is also known as Data wrangling. 
             It is a process of cleaning the data by removing the noisy, missing values and getting the data ready for the analysis.

         #4.Explore the data:

             Data exploration is the process of analyzing a large data set in an unstructured way to uncover initial patterns, characteristics, and points of interest.

         #5.Perform in-depth analysis: 

             This step is usually the meat of your project, where you apply all the cutting-edge machinery of data analysis to unearth high-value insights and predictions.

         #6.Communicate results of the analysis:

              Data storytelling is a critical and underrated skill that you will build and use here.

     #Programing Languages Used in Data Science

         #Python

             Python is a popular general-purpose programming language that can be used for a wide variety of applications. It includes high-level data structures, dynamic                    typing, dynamic binding, and many more features that make it as useful for complex application development as it is for scripting that connects components together.
             Python is built by Guido Van Rossum.

         #R

             R is a programming language and software environment for statistical analysis, graphics representation and reporting.
             R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman.

     #Data Wrangling

         Data wrangling is the process of cleaning and unifying messy and complex data sets for easy access and analysis.

         With the amount of data and data sources rapidly growing and expanding, it is getting increasingly essential for large amounts of available data to be organized for              analysis. This process typically includes manually converting and mapping data from one raw form into another format to allow for more convenient consumption and                organization of the data.

        #Data Wrangling With Pandas

              Pandas is one of the most popular Python library for data wrangling.

                 -Dropping missing or null values in the dataset.
                 -Filtering Data
                 -Grouping Data
                 -Time series data handling
                 -Exporting data
  
     #Machine Learning

         Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being                    explicitly programing. Improving the performace of computers by using the data and algorithms.

        #Supervised Machine Learning
 
             Supervised learning is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using well "labelled" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict              the output. The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.

             #Linear Prediction
        
                 Linear prediction models assume that there is a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. This means that if several                      linear models would be trained using different data, they would perform similarly on the same test data set.

                 #Linear Regression 
  
                     Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis

                 #Logistic Regression

                     Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal,                              interval or ratio-level independent variables.

             #Nonlinear Prediction
             
                 Nonlinear regression is a form of regression analysis in which data is fit to a model and then expressed as a mathematical function.

         #Unsupervised Machine Learning

             Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which models are trained using unlabeled dataset and are allowed to act on that data without any supervision.

             #Clustering

                 Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data                  points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups. It is basically a collection of objects on the basis of similarity and dissimilarity                  between them.

        #Semi Supervised Machine Learning
             
             It makes use of both labeled and unlabeled examples when learning a model.
